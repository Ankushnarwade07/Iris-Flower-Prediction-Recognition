Introduction:
Iris flower prediction and recognition refer to the task of identifying and categorizing iris flowers based on certain features extracted from their petals and sepals. This task has gained significant attention in the field of machine learning and pattern recognition. The iris flower dataset, introduced by biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936, has become a standard benchmark for evaluating classification algorithms.

Dataset:
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three different species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample includes four features – sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width – making it a four-dimensional dataset. The challenge is to build a model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on these features.

Prediction Models:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Deployment:
